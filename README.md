## The game

PewPew is a programming game loosely based on the [Real Time Battle Game](http://realtimebattle.sourceforge.net/). As with RTB players program a small bot whose goal is to be last standing one in a deathmatch game.

These bots will communicate with the game server via a WebSockets connection.

For more information about the game take a look to:

- [Game overview](./game.md)
- [Commands](./commands.md) that the bot can send and their possible response
- [Notifications](./notifications.md) that the game server can send on each game cycle
